<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

</ul><p> There are many things that can be considered choices for our topic such as AI influencing decision making, 
artificial intelligence is currently influencing our lives every day through products like the amazon alexa and siri 
without us even knowing, for example, asking where should I eat, and they respond by recommending somewhere for you 
to eat, influencing your decision and having an effect on society. <p>

<p> On a more academic level there was a study done in February of this year by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency 
where participants played a game against artificial intelligence, during the game the AI learnt people's decision making and 
targeted different things towards them highlighting the potential AI can have in decision making, which could be good or bad. 
This form of artificial intelligenceI could have positive effects on society, such as the AI learning what you like based upon
 the things you google, for example video games, this now means all ads and alike you see on the internet will be related to 
gaming to actually show you things you may be interested in. On the other hand of this, AI could go too far, and not only learn 
the things you like, but learn your passwords and personal details which would have a negative effect on society as we would lose 
faith in AI due to bad scenarios that could have been avoided, and had artificial intelligence as an aid rather than a problem. <p>

<p> Another is AI efficiency, and whether AI should be implemented into more work places. There was a study conducted by LawGeex 
in legal practise where 30 lawyers were involved against artificial intelligence evaluating 5 legal documents. The results concluded 
that AI showed an average accuracy of 94% while humans achieved 85%. Humans took an average of 93 minutes to do the work while AI 
took a mere 26 seconds proving they are more efficient and could be the future of certain industries. This form of AI application 
into a law workplace would help drastically, improving accuracy and time would allow for more cases to be run and the legal system 
to work quicker which is positive for society. A downside to this could be that if the artificial intelligence goes offline, or 
shuts down, the whole law system would grind to a halt until it is fixed which wouldn’t have any positive effects on society, 
compared to when it's up and running. Another downside to this though is that due to the artificial intelligence being implemented 
people will be losing jobs to it, which certainly is not a positive outcome. <p>

<p> On the other hand of AI efficiency and implementing it more there’s the conversation of AI limitations, and where do we draw the 
line with AI.  How intelligent will we let AI become and should it become a part of our daily lives in society, should it be limited 
in certain fields of work like medicine for data privacy and limited only to fields such as IT where it can be properly controlled and
 worked with. A good example of when people didn’t consider the limitations of artificial intelligence is when Facebook created two 
different AI humans, they started off as standard AI but once left to themselves, as they had limitations, they created their own 
language that humans couldn’t understand or decipher, which was so alarming the Facebooks AI department they were instantly shut down 
due to fears of them becoming too smart and powerful. But a choice could have been to set a limit, to program the AI to not be able to 
get this intelligent, these artificial intelligent humans could have been extremely helpful if it wasn’t for the fact they didn’t have 
limitations to stop them getting out of control, they could have had many positive effects on people in the society.<p>
