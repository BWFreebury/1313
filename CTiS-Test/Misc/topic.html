<h1>The Affects of Artificial Intellegence on Society</h1>


<p> We have chosen “The Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Society” as AI plays a massive part in the technology industry right now. 
It is changing the world as we know it and is altering the way that humans will live. It is taking jobs and responsibilities off workers, going 
against ethics posing a threat of AI sentience. On the other hand, in some fields AI is creating jobs, reducing human error and increasing 
well-being through stress and load reduction. Artificial intelligence is evolving at an exponential rate, and soon could take over everything 
humans need to do, whist simultaneously showing potential positive effects on society,  proving its importance and relevance to our assignment <p>
