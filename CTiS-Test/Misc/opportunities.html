<h1>Opportunities within A.I</h1>
</ul><h4><p>Job creation and reduction in human error.<p></h4>

<p>

  - Sources suggest that AI can lead to an increase of jobs and new skills in data science and management, claiming that while jobs will be affected, most will simply change rather than to disappear. <br>AI is not autonomous, It will need to be managed and maintained.
<br><br>
  - AI can eliminate tasks that prevent real productivity and result in an evolution of jobs, this is creating a real opportunity for growth and positive change to existing jobs. <br> Stripping away dull and tedious elements of jobs can promote a more productive and potentially a more fulfilling workforce by focusing on tasks that are more creative or exciting.
<br><br>
  -  Job possibilities with AI can be compared to that of the internet, the real gains in jobs only emerged later down the track. It can be quite strongly argued that it is simply too early to tell where jobs can go with AI, <br> much was the same with the internet.

  <strong><small>Increase in Jobs</strong></small>
  <br>The argument surrounding job creation is a tough one, new technology is not a new thing. When new technology arises it is easy to jump to the conclusion that it can only lead to negative impacts on the job market, but it seems easy to forget that whenever these new technologies come along we don't see large scale redundancies across industries. Jobs barely ever go away, they simply just change. The most commonly used example is the introduction of ATMs, when they were introduced it sparked widespread fear that these ATMS would replace bank tellers and bank staff. But these bank jobs didn't go away, they changed. There are now more bank tellers now than there were when ATMs were introduced. The reason for this is that ATMs worked alongside people, taking over some responsibilities but not all. Allowing human staff to focus on other tasks such as sales. They allowed faster and more access to customers which resulted in more money for the banks to expand. They lowered the cost to run these bank branches by introducing ATMs. This can be related to the introduction of the internet. When the internet was introduced alongside online news, shopping and email. Jumping back to the 90’s you could argue that we would have large scale job losses as people switched to using these online al;ternatives which were cheaper and more convenient. Fast forward 30 years, yes we saw a reduction in jobs in certain areas of certain industries but the internet gave birth to hundreds if not thousands of companies worth billions of dollars that brought with it jobs and other brand new technologies that too brought along new jobs. The internet gave birth to so many brand new jobs that we didn't expect could exist yet. This is what makes the argument regarding job creation with AI a tough one, because it's very easy to just assume that jobs are going to be lost. Our go to assumption when new technology comes along is that that is exactly what will happen. Taking this alongside the fact that it is almost impossible to see what new jobs can be created, what they'll do or where they’ll be. It is simply too early to tell what jobs will exist, but however we can trust that we won't see mass unemployment because history has shown us that this simply does not happen. Jobs rarely go away, they simply change. Right now we can’t suggest what jobs might exist outside of the obvious and that already really exist such as data management, development and maintenance. Currently it is important to remember that AI is not autonomous, meaning it cannot and probably should not be able to govern and control itself. This means that as we continue to use this technology, these jobs will continue to exist and continue to grow. It is also important to remember that AI is not automation, AI is smart technology that uses machine learning to make decisions and recommendations, for example the netflix movie recommendations based on what patterns you create based on what you have watched. Automation is simply dumb technology, it only follows straight forward tasks such as assembling. Automation is more of a threat to the job market, than AI is, but however is not relevant to this investigation. While Automation and AI often go hand in hand, it is important to remember its key differences that will lead to job growth.

  <br><br><strong><small>Reduction in Human Error</strong></small>
  <br>AI can have a greatly positive effect on jobs that already exist by reducing human error and creating more productive environments. By handing off the dull and tedious tasks to machines to repeat, we can leave the more creative, rewarding and impactful jobs to people. Grossman(2020) argues that an example of this could be chatbots. By this he is referring to situations such as customer support, where a message box appears with a message such as “what can I help you with?”. These are operated by AI, where they take in somewhat unique information and return programmed responses that either give the customer a solution or provides the customer with the opportunity to feed more information into the AI. While they do not take on the entire role of customer support they can take on the repetitive tasks of dealing customers and collect the relevant and necessary information and pass that on to a human who can quickly and easily provide a solution to the customer. Using this method, you save the employee having to deal with customers who can potentially be unreasonable or difficult to deal with by passing the job over to an AI bot who can't feel and is programmed to only perform a certain task until it is completed. While not every customer will be difficult to deal with, human interaction can still be tedious and unproductive and by passing it over to AI it allows the employee or company the opportunity to be more productive and therefore possibly even more rewarding. An opportunity here is that the machine can learn and can further develop its responses and suggestions. However, that would need to be regulated and maintained, further evidence that there are jobs within AI. People deserve to work in jobs that are meaningful and provide them with satisfaction in their line of work. Passing on the tedious and unpleasant aspects of a job, such as elements of customer service over to AI can result in people working in an environment that they find to be more rewarding and ultimately live better lives.

  <br><br><strong><small>Critique of Sources</strong></small><br>
  Sources do an excellent job of highlighting the differences between AI and automation, explaining “smart” and “dumb” technology. All sources lack in detailed explanation of where jobs can be created, blaming this on the infancy of the technology and that many of the possible jobs may not yet exist, yet assuring that job creation is likely. However these sources do a good job in explaining how existing jobs might evolve to create more streamlined and efficient workforce made up of both machine and people.
