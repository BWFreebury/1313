<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
<br>
<p>
  A clear ethical issue relating to AI is the possibility that businesses may not incorporate this technology to its full potential. By this I mean that instead of using AI alongside people and regular staff,<br> businesses may just turn to purely only using AI and automation. I believe this is an ethical situation because it can come as a potential complete disregard to people's right to work. The healthiest and <br> possibly even most successful way of utilising the possibility and power of AI is to use it alongside the human workforce. Treating it as an addition, not as a replacement. It has the power to improve the<br> lives of many people with jobs that already exist. There is fear that companies could be greedy and just see it as a cheap and easy replacement to a workforce which would indeed lead to large scale mass <br> unemployment. I do personally, see this is a very negative belief and through my research shown I strongly believe that this is an unlikely outcome. But it does scare me that it could happen, especially <br> if the true potential of this technology is not widely known. There are many other potential ethical risks with this technology, a quite famous one is facial recognition and the idea that people's faces go <br>into a big database and can be used to identify and even track people in public. There are also deeper ideas regarding self awareness and sentience that AI robots could eventually possess. Which result <br> in many classic ethical arguments surrounding who is actually at fault, the technology, the company, the user or the developer? Personally however, sticking to the opportunities recommend that this <br> technology is continued to be developed and introduced. Perhaps at a restricted and slow pace as it is definitely a new technology with powers that have never before been seen. But I do believe that <br> Humans have a tendency to fear the worst in terms of jobs when a new technology is introduced. And the truth is that we really have no need to, as we've been here before and no doubt will be here again. <br>We don't know what jobs could be created yet, just like the internet, ATMs and even the steam engine. However we must ensure thes technologies are introduced safely and in a manner that allows it to <br> support existing jobs, not replace them.
