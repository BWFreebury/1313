<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p> There are many ethical issues in relation to The Affect of Artificial Intelligence in Society as it is quite
a broad topic to be discussing, a clear ethical issue in my mind is the misuse of AI, such as people creating artificial
intelligence for the wrong reasons such as data theft and things of that nature. This is an ethical issue as it is
betraying the trust of society to use a powerful machine for negative purposes as the previously mentioned data theft along side
identity theft, personal details and financials to exploit whoever is in contact with the AI. Another ethical issue is of
course the loss of jobs if artificial intelligence becomes so prominent in society that it is deemed so efficient it can 
replace human workers, this is a big ethical issue as that would be prioritising artificial intelligence over our own kind, 
which in society could cause a lot more harm than good as losing your job to AI would have effects on your mental health, 
making you question if you were doing things wrong, if you weren't efficient enough etc, this isn't good as people in our
society at this point may not even want to return to work, creating a further threat of AI becoming more powerful and creating
more ethical issues within itself. My final ethical issue is in relation to autonomous things such as self driving cars, this
could be a major ethical issue as AI has been deemed to be safe enough to put our lives in its hands, but what if you're
behind the wheel of an autonomous vehicle and you get in a crash, who then is responsible? You (a member of society) as you were
behind the wheel, or is it the creators of the artificial intelligence as they didn't do enough testing to ensure that
the AI was smart enough to not get into a crash? This is an extreme grey area in relation to any form of AI as depending on 
your perspective, it could be either of those answers.<p>

<p> Overall, the ethical issues that surround artificial intelligence are of great threat to the society as it primarily
effects them and their well being, as artificial intelligence is quite young i can only hope in due time there will be 
little to no ethical issues surrounding the topic.<p>
