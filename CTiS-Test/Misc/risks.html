<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><p>With how great AI can be and the promises that have been told to us by the companies at the forefront
 of innovation it can be easy to forget just how dangerous AI could be. Without proper care and consideration is 
 taken when advancing in this field could spell the real downfall of the human race.<br><br><br>

How AI could advance to Superintellegience and pose a threat to us:<br>
One of the main risks that Artificial Intelligence poses arise as technology advances. The idea of AI obtaining 
sentience and turning on humans has been tossed around in the media and can be seen as a joke however, the possibility 
is real and needs to be addressed as research progresses. The term Superintelligence is used when referring to AI that 
has surpassed humans in cognitive power and can complete tasks at a superhuman efficiency. Something like this has the 
power to drastically increase the speed that humans advance in all fields of technology. Creating a society where humans 
have everything we dreamed of when we think of the “future”, flying cars, a cure for cancer, no world hunger or wars. However, 
it also has a very high possibility of turning bad, the superintelligence obtaining sentience and becoming self-aware could 
cause a massive problem if it decides that it does not want to work with humans as it can easily become unimaginably powerful 
due to its intellect. This could pose a very big threat and must be considered when progressing with research involving AI.<br><br><br>

How AI will cause a massive loss in jobs for many people:<br>
A great risk may come to the surface when we take into consideration how “perfect” AI is, and how no human can match it in
 repetitive jobs such as a factory worker. We must take into consideration how many people we would be putting out of work 
 by creating AI that is able to complete simple tasks. It has been predicted that in the next 30 years over half of all jobs 
 will be lost to AI. While not a risk that sounds as bad as the world being overrun by robots, this is different because this 
 risk is an intended consequence and something that humans are trying to work towards rather than something that just might 
 happen. Meaning that if we do not find a solution to this many people will lose their jobs alongside the advancement of AI.<br><br><br>

How AI could be used for war if it falls into the wrong hands:<br>
Finally, perhaps the most immediate risk of all is the chance of good AI being used for bad by bad people as weapons. Fighting 
wars with AI instead of real people could create a reality where boundaries are pushed and much more powerful weapons are used 
that could wipe out all of humanity. Elon Musk, someone at the forefront of AI advancements known for his work towards self-driving
 cars and the AI they use said “AI is far more dangerous than nukes.” suggesting that by trying to advance our civilization all the 
 advancements that we make towards AI may just advance them to the point of self-awareness causing the possibility of them turning on us.
 As farfetched as something like this may sound it is a real possibility if we are not careful and we must take extreme caution 
 when continuing with research and advancements in artificial intelligence.<br><br><br>
 
Artificial Intelligence has many risks associated with it however it is for good reason that it is still being worked on in an attempt 
to bring civilization into the next era as it is the answer to so many of our problems. If we are able to use it for good it can be the 
very thing to progress every field of technology.<br><br>
