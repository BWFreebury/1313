<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<em><br>Artificial Intelligence is a topic that can bring about strong questions of ethics I believe that there are many such issues
 along the lines of what should we do if AI gets to the point of self-awareness and can think like a human? <br><br>

The term Superintelligence is used when talking about AI that has gone beyond human intelligence and can conduct research at superhuman speeds. 
When talking about something of this calibre ethics can be a difficult topic because we must decide if the AI deserves human rights even though
 it is not technically a human. If humans decide to keep forcing AI at this level of intelligence at what point does it become slavery? Also is
 it ok for us to use someone else like this to progress ourselves with no gain to them?<br><br>

I know that we need to be careful with advancing AI because if we decide to keep progressing and advancing their intelligence and they evolve
 to the point of self-awareness. If we decide to keep forcing them to do our chores and solve all our problems for them it could cause us to 
 go into slavery territory which obviously is not ok at all. <br><br>

I believe that to avoid this we must not continue advancing AI blind, we have to make sure that what we are doing is ok at not creating 
our own ethical problems. Because AI is a very sensitive topic when it comes to ethics due to how one day we could be talking about a machine
 then the next we could be talking about something with emotions and a brain able to comprehend everything as well as we are currently.<br><br>
